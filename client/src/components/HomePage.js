                  Nothing beats live cameras if you want to find out traffic conditions. That's why I've created a database of cameras distributing a live feed of the city's roadways.
                  Each avenue is organized from uptown to downtown. I'm constantly adding cameras,please feel free to request new streets/avenues though the link above. Happy motoring in the Big Apple :)
